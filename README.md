# Risk_Assessment_Framework_Dharavi

At the heart of the bustling city of Mumbai – India’s financial capital – filled with high rises and glass buildings, lies Dharavi, one of the largest and oldest slums of Asia. Housing up to 1 million people over approximately 2.39 square kilometers (590 acres), gives rise to its hazardous living conditions and high levels of poverty. This report is a proposal from Resilient City Builders (RCB) for a Risk Management Plan for Dharavi. If approved by the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) – the governing civic body of Mumbai, the framework this plan provides can be executed in a timeframe of 1 year, 4 months.

## Risk Management Process: 

There are 6 stages of this framework:

## Identifying Potential Risk

In this stage, building upon the insights gathered from the previous outreach initiative, comprehensive reports, and historical data, potential risks to Dharavi are to be identified. Each identified risk is systematically categorized into one of three distinct categories:

## Analyze Potential Risk

This section of the assessment aims to qualitatively comprehend and articulate the consequences associated with each previously identified potential risk. The focus is on delineating the impacts across four crucial dimensions:

## Rank Risks

The next step in the framework is to rank the risk from most hazardous to least.

## Risk Management Strategies

Once all risks have been ranked, the next step is to assign a risk management strategy for each risk. The four risk management strategies that would be used to deal with each risk are:

To further elaborate on the risk management strategies, the table below gives an example of how each of these strategies can be implemented. By the end of this stage of the assessment, a report, like the table below, is to be made for all the identified risks.
